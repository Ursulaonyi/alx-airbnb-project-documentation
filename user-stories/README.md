# User Stories Directory

## Overview
This directory contains user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend project. User stories are derived from the use case diagram and represent functional requirements from the user's perspective.

## Files in this Directory

### `user-stories.md`
Contains 22 comprehensive user stories covering:
- **User Management** (Registration, Login, Profile Management)
- **Property Management** (Create, Edit, Delete Listings)
- **Search and Discovery** (Search, Filter, View Details)

- **Payment Processing** (Process Payments, Receive Payouts)
- **Reviews and Ratings** (Leave Reviews, Respond to Reviews)
- **Administrative Functions** (Admin Dashboard, User Management, Content Moderation)
- **Notifications** (Booking and System Notifications)

## User Story Format
Each user story follows the standard format:
```
As a [user type]
I want [goal/functionality]
So that [benefit/reason]
```

## Priority Levels
Stories are classified into three priority levels:
- **High Priority (Must Have)**: Core functionality required for MVP
- **Medium Priority (Should Have)**: Important features for user experience
- **Low Priority (Nice to Have)**: Enhancement features for future iterations

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Each user story should be implemented with proper acceptance criteria
- Stories should be broken down into technical tasks during sprint planning
- All stories require unit and integration testing
- API endpoints should be documented for each story

### For Product Managers
- Use priority levels for sprint planning and backlog management
- Stories can be modified based on user feedback and business requirements
- New stories should follow the same format and documentation standards

### For QA Engineers
- Acceptance criteria serve as the basis for test cases
- Each story represents a testable feature or functionality
- User stories should be validated against the original use case diagram

## Integration with Development Process

1. **Sprint Planning**: Select stories based on priority and team capacity
2. **Development**: Implement backend APIs and business logic for each story
3. **Testing**: Validate acceptance criteria through automated and manual testing
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation for implemented stories
5. **Review**: Ensure stories align with business requirements and user needs

## Maintenance
This document should be updated when:
- New user stories are identified
- Existing stories are modified or removed
- Priority levels change based on business decisions
- Acceptance criteria are refined during development
