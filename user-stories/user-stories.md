4. **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages and proper HTTP status codes
5. **Performance**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data like search results
6. **Security**: Ensure all sensitive operations require proper authentication and authorization
7. **Testing**: Each user story should have corresponding unit and integration tests
8. **Documentation**: API endpoints should be documented for frontend integration
