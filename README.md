# 📌 Airbnb Clone Project Documentation


# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend 

Welcome to the **Airbnb Clone Backend** documentation. This project outlines the planning, research, and technical specifications necessary to build a scalable, secure, and feature-rich backend for an Airbnb-like rental marketplace application.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This document serves as the foundational analysis for developing the backend system of an Airbnb Clone. The focus is on identifying **key features**, **technical requirements**, and **non-functional expectations** to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable system.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To define and document the essential backend features and functionalities required to build a secure, scalable, and user-centric Airbnb-like application. This involves:

- Understanding the business scope and user needs.
- Structuring backend features through use cases, data flows, and user stories.
- Designing systems that support user registration, property bookings, payments, and admin operations.

## 🧠 Requirement

### 1. 🔍 Understanding the Project Scope
- **Business Goals:** Analyze what the platform is designed to achieve.
- **Stakeholder Interviews:** Gather requirements from clients, users, and project managers.

### 2. 🗂️ Defining Features and Functionalities
- **Feature Listing:** E.g., user authentication, booking system, and payment integration.
- **Functional Specs:** Define inputs, processing logic, and expected outputs.

### 3. 📘 Documentation Techniques
- **User Stories:** Describe how different users interact with the system.
- **Use Case Diagrams:** Visualize actor-system interactions.
- **Flowcharts:** Outline system logic and data flow.
- **Data Models:** Design ER diagrams to define structure and relationships.
